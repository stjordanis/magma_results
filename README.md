# Magma Results

This repo holds the results of analyzing Magma-injected bugs (through bug
reports) and of running fuzzing campaigns against instrumented target programs.

In the `povs/` directory, you will find two subdirectories:

* `reports/`: contains PoVs that are exctracted from public bug reports
* `campaigns/`: contains PoVs that result from fuzzing campaigns, including new
  crashes
